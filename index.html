        <h1>Bat's Favorite Recipes</h1>
        <h2>Start with dessert!</h2>
            <p>Like any good bat meal, this one starts with dessert. Check out my favorite <a href="recipes/chocolatepudding.html">chocolate pudding</a> recipe!</p>
        <h2>Carbs are what's for dinner!</h2>
            <p><a href="recipes/friedrice.html">Fried rice</a> sounds like a health food right? It's pretty much just old rice fried in oil with a smattering of veg and protein. It's a bat classic! Carbs!</p>
        <h2>A refreshing finish</h2>
            <p>Even bats don't like going to bed covered in chocolate, so it's best to finish with something fresh. There's nothing fresher than a fresh <a href="recipes/mangolassi.html">mango lassi</a> to finish off the night.</a></p>
