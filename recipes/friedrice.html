        <h2>Fried Rice: With a little prep, it's not too hard</h2>
            <p>Here's a story all about friend rice. Maybe it's a personal anecdote or something funny. Maybe it's a story about how I failed to make fried rice and had to try and try again.</p>
            <p>Here's some sort of bs positive spin to try to convince you to make my friend rice. Also, please click on my links so I can make some monnnnnneeeeyyyyyy.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><em>White Long-Grain Rice:</em> Day old and cold rice help to keep it from being mushy.</li>
                <li><em>Small White Onion:</em> Make sure not to get a red one! They're too sweet.</li>
                <li><em>Peas and Carrots:</em> They're veggies. Not much to say here.</li>
                <li><em>Eggs:</em> But not all in one basket!</li>
                <li><em>Soy Sauce:</em> Did you know it's actually made from soy beans?</li>    
                <li><em>Green Onions:</em> AKA chives or challots? Not really sure what the difference is. Although, I'm sure there is a difference...</li> 
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Preheat Skillet:</em> Turn your skillet to medium high heat and pour sesame oil into the bottom of your skillet and add the onion, peas and carrots. Fry this until they are tender.</li>
                <li><em>Slide the veggies to the side:</em> Pour the beaten eggs onto the other side. Use a spatula to scramble the eggs. Mix them together with the veggies.</li>
                <li><em>Add the rice:</em> Combine it with the veggie and egg mixture. Pour the soy sauce on top and stir until it is heated throughout. Garnish with green onions.</li>
            </ol>
